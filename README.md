About this fork
---------------

I decide to implement this XMPPHP library to one of my own projects (GTalk bot),
I appreciate too much the time and effort that some people did it to build this
class and I think that if I refactor the library to clarify the code some users
could be apreciated. This is why I forked this repository :)

Any pull request are welcome!
